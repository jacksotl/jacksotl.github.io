# Application of MySQL using Survey Questions

This project focused on data and databases. Databases organize data so that retrieval of this data is simple. 
MySQL is a program used to store information in databases. SQL stands for structured query language. MySQL can be used
create new databases and store data in tables.

## Assignment briefing
A 5 question survey was created using a bash script so that questions would be prompted to the user and stored
in a csv file. Each response had its own unique key so that mySQL would run smoothly and not confuse the data entries. 
The unique key for my survey answers was the date and time a person completed the survey.

The survey questions were:

1. 
2.
3.
4.
5.
