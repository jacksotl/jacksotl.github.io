## I Made Something cool!

Using a software called Reveal.js I made a cooler and less boring version of a typical powerpoint
presentation. Everything was done using Codeanywhere because github can automatically build slides
given the right html5 conversion from markdown text.

Audio and images were added by downloading images from the web and using audacity to record myself
with music in the background. 

I chose the 90s topic because I wanted my presentation to be bright and funny. Everyone has some good 
memories from the 90s so its a topic that a lot of people can reflect back on with a sense of nostalgia. 

Here is a link to my presentation:
